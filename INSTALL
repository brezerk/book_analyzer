Test assigment
***********************************************

Your task is to write a program, BookAnalyzer, that analyzes such a log file.
BookAnalyzer takes one command line argument: target‐size. BookAnalyzer then
reads a market data log on standard input. As the book is modified,
BookAnalyzer prints (on standard output) the total expense you would incur if
you bought target‐size shares (by taking as many asks as necessary, lowest
first), and the total income you would receive if you sold target‐size shares
(by hitting as many bids as necessary, highest first). Each time the income or
expense changes, it prints the changed value.
